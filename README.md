## Installation

If you're already up and running with most of the usual Node ecosystem tools this demo won't require much additional effort.

### Required

*   Install [npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm).

## Setup

*   Install all package dependencies by running `npm install`. This will fetch all dependencies listed in `package.json`. You may see warnings about deprecated packages and what-not; that's probably fine, just keep going!

### Compiling

*   Run `gulp build` or `gulp build --env=development` to compile.
